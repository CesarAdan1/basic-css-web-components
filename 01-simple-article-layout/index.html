			<h1>Hello.</h1>
			<p>Mark Boulton design was a small design studio. In 2014, <a href="#">we were aquired by
				Monotype.</a></p>
			<p>Over the years, we <a href="#">built an amazing team</a> and worked on some <a href="#">tremendous
				projects with the smartest clients</a>. That's something we're proud of, and
				thankful for. But, it's time for a change.</p>
			<p>The move to Monotype brings us closer to the problems we want to fix. Mark
				Boutlon Design is now closed. The team will be working on Monotype projects
				from the same premises in the UK and we'll still be writing, blogging, and still
				speaking at web conferences. We're not going anywhere.</p>
